(Think $k$-means, where you guess which cluster each data point belongs to, then reestimate where the clusters are, and repeat.)

        "\n",
        "HMMs used to be very popular in natural language processing, but they have largely been overshadowed by neural network models like RNNs and Transformers. Still, it is fun and instructive to study the HMM; some commonly used machine learning techniques like [Connectionist Temporal Classification](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf) are inspired by HMM methods. HMMs are [still used in conjunction with neural networks in speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07453), where the assumption of a one-hot state makes sense for modelling phonemes, which are spoken one at a time."
